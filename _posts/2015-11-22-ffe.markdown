So Free For Everyone (FFE) was an idea a friend of mine came up with to try and connect people with a surplus of things with people with a need of things. This idea would be applied to things like furniture, food, clothes, or whatever. Think like [Copia][Copia], but for all things.

This whole thing happened at our school's yearly hackathon, where I was going to find some random people and build dumb stuff like Google Maps Battleship, except with more monetization. Instead, I ran into my friend who already had a group of people from the contracting place she works at. They gave me an invite and I went along.

The application we built used a front end service built in Ionic, as well as a backend server built using Node.js and Express. In a team of five, four people handled the front end portion of the project, while I handled the backend, setting up a MongoDB database using Compose, deploying the server to the IBM cloud servers, and building a decently simple CRUD API, with the ability to like items and add them to your listings (basically like following on Twitter, but for inanimate objects).

Honestly though, most of my work on this project was spent doing dev ops, configuring cloud servers and services to work with our project more so than doing actual programming.

[Here's the API][FFE_API]

As for the mobile side of it, the other guys mostly handled that, since they already worked with Ionic where they worked. (Shoutout to [The Portal at UCI][Portal_Link]. If you're looking for people to hire that aren't me, give these guys a shot.). They got their stuff done, and we demoed at the hackathon.

[The Mobile Stuff][FFA]

We ended up winning a category at the Hackathon for using an SMS integration service. Nothing better than a free Amazon Echo. Though the hackathon's done, the project has kinda faded. I dunno, maybe we'll see it in app stores soon.
