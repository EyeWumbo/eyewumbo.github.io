Hey, I'm Steven. If you're here, that means you're considering the possibility of hiring me for your company, in which case, I love you. But besides that, here's a breakdown of me.

I've been programming for the last six years now, including both professional and hobbyist experience. I originally started with Python back in high school, as a way to get out of doing my statistics homework. During the school year, a friend of mine told me that we could take the AP Computer Science test without actually having to take an AP class. All we would have to do is go from zero knowledge in computer science as a whole to thorough understanding of Object Oriented design and concepts, plus gotchas specific to Java. Me and my friends, being the intellectual masochists we were, decided "why the hell not". And everything turned out alright, with all of us scoring a 4 out of 5 on the exam.

So after that was college. I went to UC Irvine, where I helped develop video games and *attempted* to start businesses. During my time as an amateur video game developer, I developed a passionate hatred for Java (which is part of a decent understanding of it). On the technical side, I worked with graphics libraries, OO architectural design, and a touch of Android development. On the non-technical side, I'd like to think that I helped our project manager not cry himself to sleep by being technical and hitting milestones. In terms of my "entrepreneurial" experience, I've been a participant in our university's business plan competition, and tried to launch a few products here and there. Emphasis on tried.

While in college, I learned about these things called hackathons, which I discovered to be caffeine fueled sessions of code and Google. You'll see some of the projects that I worked on for some of these hackathons right here on this site. Some of these projects could actually be useful to society, while others let you play battleships on Google Maps. Give them a read if you're interested (links to source code available in each post).

I also had an internship at an "early" stage start-up. I definitely learned a lot working at there, in the same way that falling into the Pacific Ocean from a burning plane teaches you to sink or swim. I did get to be king of a part of Atlantis for a while though, and that was pretty cool. I somehow transitioned from lowly intern to de facto "lead" front end developer. And by "lead", I mean the guy everybody goes to when they have questions about how to do something using CSS, or if they want these new designs up tout suite. This transition was due to the fact that most of the senior guys got pissed and left, leaving the office almost entirely full of underpaid interns and one senior guy working remotely. Also, I was pretty good with CSS and was like the only guy who bothered to learn the flexbox model that we were implementing to replace our then-current grid system.

I ended up walking away with a decent understanding of the Ruby on Rails stack and web development as a whole. There are definitely some things I'm trying to unlearn regarding processes though.

And that's the full brief on my experience as a programmer / software developer / engineer / whatever the hot new title is on HackerNews. Oh, I also have a college degree (BS, Comp. Sci.).

Besides enjoying myself, there's a reason why I haven't gone with the whole "Dear Sir/Madam whom it may concern" tone over the course of this... thing. You might have come to some judgment of me as "Lame", "Cool", or "How unprofessional!! Good day to you sir!" based on how I write, and as an extension, probably how I speak. And that's good. So now you have a brief understanding of my credentials and some understanding of who I am and maybe how I might mesh with the culture of your workplace. Not that you needed me to point that out. Dammit Steven.

Alright, that's that. Hope you're now informed of my development experience, or at least entertained. Or both. Both is good too.
